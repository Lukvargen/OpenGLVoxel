# OpenGLVoxel
Simple voxel terrain generator in C++ and OpenGL

Infinite terrain generation split into chunks.
Able to modify blocks, either set or destroy with right and left mouse buttons

This project was for me to learn C++ and OpenGL. Never got around to implement all the features I wanted but the terrain generation is there.
